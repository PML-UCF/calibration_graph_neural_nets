# Calibration of computer models with graphs and neural networks

We propose an approach for calibration of computer models using graph theory and neural networks.
Using observed data, we simultaneously calibrate model parameters and estimate model discrepancies through neural networks.
This allows us to estimate the missing physics (discrepancy term) even for hidden nodes of the graph.
